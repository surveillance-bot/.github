# Built during Chandigarh Police - Infosys Hackathon
## October 2022 


Our project called ChanPol (derived from InterPol) smoothens the process of collecting evidences against a crime, given the facial identity of suspect is known. It can collect important intel such as the location tracking, location history and course of suspect's actions to monitor them by aiming at face extraction and detection applied onto the video footage of 2,000+ pre-installed CCTVs spreaded over 114 km2 area to capture various angles and views.
